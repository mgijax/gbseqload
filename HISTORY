2) gbseqload.sh 
     - changed GBSEQLOAD_APP to SEQLOAD_APP. changed CONFIG_GBLOAD
       to CONFIG_LOAD. 
     - added call to radardbutilities getfilesToProcess.csh and 
       logProcessedFiles.csh. Gets input files from RADAR
       when in incremental LOAD_MODE and then logs those files in RADAR 
     - Added test for RADAR_NONCUM_INPUT in order to override
       getting input files from RADAR when in incremental mode (mostly for
       testing, but may be needed to process an adhoc file)
