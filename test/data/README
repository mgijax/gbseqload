The data files in this directory contain bogus data designed to test 
the seqload for each type of event. 

To test:
1) Configure gbseqload, 
set APP_INFILES=<full path to nctest.flat.gz> and APP_RADAR_INPUT=false

2) Run gbseqload.sh

3) Do 1 and 2 again changing APP_INFILES=<full path to nctest2.flat.gz>

This file should cause two invocations of the load from jobstream.
Note that the dummy event depends on a sequence in MGI which has been
a dummy since the initial release. It is a synthetic sequence which 
cannot be determined to be a mouse, so it should continue to be reported
as a dummy sequence in this test.
